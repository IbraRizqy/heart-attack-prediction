## 🫀 Heart Attack Prediction

I built a heart attack prediction model using data from Kaggle. I used **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**, and improved both with **hyperparameter tuning** to get better results.

- 📊 **Data**: Includes features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.  
- ⚙️ **Models**: Random Forest performed slightly better than Logistic Regression.  
- 🧪 **Tuning**: Used `GridSearchCV` to find the best parameters.  
- ✅ **Result**: Both models showed solid performance with balanced metrics.

Built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Jupyter Notebook**.
